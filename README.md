# Commerce-92---UpdateImport-Products
Sitecore 92 upload products has some limitation. It does only support replace. It simply remove those products and upload again. 
What we solved here is, If the product does exists, it will escape that and and upload only new products. If users want to replace any existing products, possible by passing
correct parameters.
